#Rotoblin-L4D2

----
## What is Rotoblin?
**Rotoblin** is(was) the last widely used/accepted competitive configuration for the original Left 4 Dead. It was the first to acknowledge the unbalanced and non-competitive nature of deadstops against hunters. Thus it became the first and the last config in L4D to remove them.

As opposed to what other *Retro*-type config developers of L4D2 try to do, I will not try to bring Rotoblin-L4D2 as ridiculously close to L4D1 as possible. It makes no sense to implement outdated, unlogical gameplay elements such as L4D1 scoring or lack of mapchanges, only for the sake of creating the nostalgical effect and feel of the original game. If I'm going to make a competitive config that resembles L4D1, I'm going to make it as modern as possible. Ideally I would want it to reach the point where the only difference from EQ or PM Redtown would be reduced to just the lack of L4D2 SI. But given the nature of Hunter+Smoker+Boomer only gameplay, it might require a bit more tweaking than that. A task I am ready to face, as long as enough interest in Rotoblin-L4D2 is shown!

## Changelog
#### Version 3.4: First public release
